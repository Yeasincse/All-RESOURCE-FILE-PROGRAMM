      3) Why should you after 3 years working anywhere or not?
      4) Writing about some techonology of your project university /personal project?
 2) Programming part 1
     1) Write about quicksort has best work or worst?
     2)Write about bublesort has best work or worst?
     3)Write about margesort has best work or worst?which efficient?
     4) Swap value change interchange without any temporaly variable or builtin method? if you consider any two value a=4 and b=8
       that aslike result a=8 and b=4 output.
     5) Given that rekursion that n=n+1
                                  n=n+1+n+2
                                  n=n+1+n+2+n+3 .....
                                  that 
                                  int(func1,funct2)
                                  if func2=0
                                    return 0

   6)writing code that 
             pangram coding as like 
                   c code
   7) writing code that  array[]={1,2,3.5} that multiply more value in array .now you show 2nd number value in the array sorting
    this value.writing this code
   8)writing code that multipy array in the two dimensional array  created. find out any value position 
          value  array[n]  aslike something

       1.What will be the output of the program?
           public class Foo 
            {  
          public static void main(String[] args) 
          {
             try 
            { 
            return; 
             } 
          finally 
          {
            System.out.println( "Finally" ); 
                } 
              } 
          }
          
          A.	Finally
          B.	Compilation fails.
          C.	The code runs with no output.
          D.	An exception is thrown at runtime.
          
          
      2)  the output this......

                 protected int x, y;
                    }
 
        class Main {
            public static void main(String args[]) {
               Test t = new Test();
                System.out.println(t.x + " " + t.y);
                       }
                    }
